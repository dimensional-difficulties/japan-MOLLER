!**************************************************************************
! Geometry information for the BPMs in injector beamline.
!**************************************************************************
!
! X/Yoffset - The difference in the ideal position and the surveyed position of a BPM in X/Y axis.
!
! Z offset  - The location of the BPM in the hallC beamline (alog Z axis) from the begining of the beamline
!             to the center of the device/ origin of device coordinate system.
!
! BSEN scaling factor - Bpm SENsitivity scaling factor is the ratio of general BSEN = 18.81 adc counts/mm 
!                       seen in most of the BPMs in the injector and the actual BSEN of a BPM. 
!                       Almost all the BPMs in the injector beamline except 1I02,1I04,1I06,0I01,0I01A.0I02,0I02A,0I05,0I07 
!                       who has BSEN=13.7 adc counts/mm
!                       So we use this factor to apply such changes.
!
! AlphaX/Y  - Relative gains of the individual XM,YM pairs compared to XP,YP pairs.
! 
! The units of the offsets are in millemeters to be comparable with the units of the anaysis results.
!
! BSEN, ALPHAX and ALPHA Y were obtained from EPICS.
!
! For BPMs that don't have factors or offsets given in the list below, default values will
! be assigned. 
!   default  offset (X/Y/Z) = 0.0
!   default BSEN scaling factor = 18.81
!   default AlphaX/AlphaY = 1.0

! device type, device_name, Xoffset, Yoffset, Zoffset, BSEN scaling factor, AlpaX, AlpaY

!!!!!  BSEN scale values adapted from Caryn's pan control.db file, 2018jul26
!!!!!  0i and 1i BPMS, BSEN scale = 13.7/18.81   = 0.728336
!!!!!  0L and 0R BPMs, BSEN scale = 18.76/18.81  = 0.99734184
!!!!!  2i BPMs,        BSEN scale = 25.67 /18.81 = 1.3647
