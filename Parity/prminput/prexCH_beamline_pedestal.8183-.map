!Unser calibration based on Run 1214 , HAPLOG 3609, also consistent with dave mack 3.7mV/uA halog entry 3689440 
 UNSER, -174.1, 2.066e-2	    

!From run 5382 https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3755873
 hallc_bcm_4c, -155, 0.001507

!  The pedestal for beam_mod_ramp should match the "bmod_ramp" pedestal value from the prex_beammod_pedestal.*.map.
!  The baseline offset in run 7628 is -293.509, so set the channel pedestal to -283.509.
beam_mod_ramp,  -283.509,  1.000

!BCM Pedestals w.r.t. Unser -> using BCM Analog US
